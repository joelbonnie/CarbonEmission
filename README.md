<h1> Carbon Emission Tracker </h1>

The main aim of this program is to create a visual representation of the different Carbon emission sources and to compare the carbon emission of various countries.

First, an SQL database is created using a CSV file for the information. After extracting and importing values once, it neednâ€™t be done again. 

Using the graphical interface, the user can specify whether to compare the carbon emissions of two specific countries, that of a particular country and the global average, or the various sources of a given country. The user can also select the option of a country list to show which countries are supported. 

Using bar graphs, a visual representation of this information is given to the user. This created graph can be saved for further use or for comparison.
